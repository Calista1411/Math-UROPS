Title: Detecting Recombinations in SARS-CoV-2

Abstract:

Genetic recombination plays a crucial role in the evolution of RNA viruses, with the potential
to rapidly alter the properties of a viral pathogen. Its presence is therefore an important
consideration in the development of treatments and vaccines. This paper introduces key
concepts in coalescent theory, including models of mutation and recombination commonly
employed in computational tools for recombination detection. We provide a concise overview
of the biological features of viral recombination and highlight the significance of studying
recombination in SARS-CoV-2 amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

We subsequently review a range of recombination detection methods, focusing on sequence-
based methods such as the Pairwise Homoplasy Index (PHI) test, Genetic Algorithm for
Recombination Detection (GARD), and Bayesian approaches. These are contrasted with a
network-based approach, KwARG. We apply these methods to analyse regionally stratified
SARS-CoV-2 genomic data from early 2021. While the findings suggested minimal to no
recombination in the Asia and North America samples, results from the Europe and Africa
samples showed inconsistencies across methods. We conclude with a discussion of the ongoing
challenges in detecting viral recombination and propose potential directions for future research,
particularly in light of the high mutation rates characteristic of SARS-CoV-2.
